Proj11 was my final project for CSE 231.  I completed the project on time but spent a 
couple days after trying to make it way better.  For example one of the problems was that
turtle graphics couldn't handle drawing multiple lines fast so the original project drew 
squares individually.  And then I also spent some time modifying the speed function.  

Counters_and_tips.py was used as a program to help play a game.  It used a site to look up
the characters that counter a particular character.  And then it also displayed information
about where to stand near the character.  How far away one characters pull is, etc...

Verbe_chercheur was used to help me learn french conjugation.  I made a program to create 
verb.txt and then a program to use verb.txt.  I wrote this in the beginning of cse 231 so I
would definitely approach this differently.
