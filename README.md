Proj11 was my final project for CSE 231.  I completed the project on time but spent a 
couple days after trying to make it way better.  For example one of the problems was that
turtle graphics couldn't handle drawing multiple lines fast so the original project drew 
squares individually.  And then I also spent some time modifying the speed function.
